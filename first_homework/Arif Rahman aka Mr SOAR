// Section 1
// Answer 1
// 1. The difference between const, let and var is
// that constant (const) has a value that I will not change in my work. 
// Whereas, let has a variable on which I will change the near future.
// Variable (var) is can be gloablly or locally defined. That makes it have a lot of bug when compared to let.

// Section 2
const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kelvin';
const f = false;

console.log(a!==b)
console.log(c>d)
console.log(a+b==c)
console.log('Name'=='Name')
console.log(a*a==d)
console.log(e!='Kevin')
console.log(48!=='48')
console.log(f!==e)
console.log(a!==b)


var g=0
console.log(g)
var g= b+c
console.log(g)
//I chose "var" because I will be changing the value of g and it is within the same global scope.
//If I have chosen let or const, there will be an error showing that g has been declared in line 27.

//var 10=g
//console.log(g)
//writing the code as 10=g will give a SyntaxError:unexpected number.

//Replace the underscores to make a Boolean expression that evaluates to true. 
//Use > , < and === only.
//a _ (b || f) _ !f && d _ c
//4 < (53 or false) === (not) false and 16 < 57
// true              true               true
console.log(a < (b || f) ===!f && d < c)
