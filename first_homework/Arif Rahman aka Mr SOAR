# Move `millenium_falcon` into `death_star`

# Move `princess_leia.txt` into the `millenium_falcon`
mv princess_leia.txt millenium_falcon #(Arif) Fun fact! if it is a .txt file you do not need to write the folder name before it to put inside a folder. Faster way to solve things.

mv galaxy_far_far_away/yavin_4/x_wing galaxy_far_far_away #(Arif) Do remember that you need to now right three levels of folders.

# In `death_star`, create directories for `tie_fighter_1`, `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`
cd galaxy_far_far_away
cd death_star
mkdir tie_fighter_1 tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3 #(Arif) Fun fact! you can create all three folders at one go. Badums!

# Move `darth_vader.txt` into `tie_fighter_1`
mv darth_vader.txt tie_fighter_1

# Make a copy of `storm_trooper.txt` in both `tie_fighter_2` and `tie_fighter_3`
#(Arif) I tried touch storm_trooper.txt tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3 without entering and it didn't work. I tried cp touch storm_trooper.txt tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3 and it didn't work too.
#(Arif) Do the long way of entering, creating and exiting.
cd tie_fighter_2
touch storm_trooper.txt
cd ..
cd tie_fighter_3

# Move all of the `tie_fighters` out of the `death_star` and into `galaxy_far_far_away`

cd .. #(Arif) exit to galaxy_far_far_away

# Be careful with this command - cannot undo!

# Make sure you delete the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).

# This command will typically not ask you if you really want to delete. It will just delete so doublecheck you are deleting exactly what you mean to delete

# Remove `tie_fighters` 2 and 3.
rm -r tie_fighter_2 tie_fighter_3 #(Arif) You must include the "-r" because it is a directory

# Touch a file in "**x_wing**" called "**the_force.txt**".
touch x_wing/the_force.txt #(Arif) save time. use a shortcut in typing.

# Destroy the "**death_star**" and anyone inside of it.
